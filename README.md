# CNN_Image_Classifier

Project Description:

The project involves building an image classifier using deep learning techniques. The image classifier will be able to classify images into different categories. The project will be implemented in Python using the TensorFlow library.

Here are the steps involved in building the image classifier:

Dataset Preparation: Collect a dataset of images for different categories. The dataset should be split into training and testing sets.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data to normalize and resize the images to a standard size.

Model Creation: Create a deep learning model using TensorFlow. The model should have multiple layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fully connected layers.

Model Training: Train the model on the training dataset. Use techniques like data augmentation and regularization to prevent overfitting.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing dataset. Calculate the accuracy and other performance metrics.

Model Deployment: Deploy the model to classify new images. loads the CIFAR-10 dataset, normalizes the pixel values, defines a CNN model, compiles the model, trains the model, evaluates the model, and plots the accuracy and loss curves.

The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 images
